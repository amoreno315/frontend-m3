# Project Name

Qbox

## Description

Qbox is a web application that facilitates the user to organize their personal items, either for a move or to store objects that are not used on a daily basis.
The user will be able to register and create an inventory, including photos of the objects and to have located in which box it is.
Each box will have an identifying title as well as a QR code label, which the user can scan with the mobile to obtain a list of the objects inside that box.
Said QR code and title of the box will also indicate to the user where his / her location is located, being able to be in a repository, garage, storage room, closet, etc.
The user will also have an object search engine, obtaining the identifier of the box and its location, in case of success in the search.
